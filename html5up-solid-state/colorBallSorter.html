					<!-- <h3 class="major">Description</h3> -->
					<p>In this project, through the addition of computer vision, we created the functionality for the
						3D printed Hephaestus arm to pick and sort colored balls on a checkerboard. Topics researched
						before
						initiating the project were camera calibration and image masking. For both of these tasks, much
						of
						it was simplified through MATLABâ€™s computer vision toolbox. However, it was important to
						understand how these concepts functioned as both selecting the image masking and part of
						extrinsic camera calibration was manually completed. Once recognition of color and ball
						locations were completed, making the arm pick up and drop off the balls at their corresponding
						required knowledge of inverse and forward kinematics for the 3 DoF arm.
